This is a simple advertising website for the food truck, Kentucky Cowboy Barbecue serving the community of Louisville, Kentucky. It includes menu, photos, links to contact, and the ability to add your email to a contact list to follow and find the location of the mobile food truck, or to book a private event.

The website uses html, css & JavaScript to deliver the information and to deliver the message to different size screens. It is designed as a primarily informative website to assist the business, Kentucky Cowboy Barbecue food truck.

Any suggestions for improvements or issues found can be submitted to me on github, and will be considered.

Thanks for taking a look.
